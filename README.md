# Commentary of Dotfiles

This site introduces `WezTerm` and `Neovim` `dotfiles` that I usually use😉

But Japanese only for now. I want to make an English site too❗

This is not an exhaustive list of all settings, but only an explanation for the settings I use.

I would be happy if it gives a hint to those who looked at it or helps them in any way😄

## Personal Thoughts on AI Applications

This site is essentially built on the creation and production of myself and many others, but uses AI in the following two respects.

- We use AI translation tools.
- In some cases, I use AI-generated program code.

I am positive about the progress of AI. It simply looks interesting, and translation into other languages is indispensable for me,
as I can only handle Japanese.

However, I am against "those who try to compare AI and humans side by side”.

I believe that coexistence, not competition, is the form we should be aiming for❗
