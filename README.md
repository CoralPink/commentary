# Commentary of Dotfiles

This site introduces `WezTerm` and `Neovim` `dotfiles` that I usually use😉

But Japanese only for now. I want to make an English site too❗

This is not an exhaustive list of all settings, but only an explanation for the settings I use.

I would be happy if it gives a hint to those who looked at it or helps them in any way😄

## Thanks
